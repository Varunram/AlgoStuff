lets take the example
10 6
2 -5 1 3 0 0 -4 -3 1 0

summer tire
  if the next element is summer, continue
  if the next element is winter change
winter tire
  remove the next (upd_current_life) elements from array
  if the remaining array contains no negative numbers, use the same tire
  else
    idk

Algo flow:-
2 - Summer Tire fine
Next element -5, so change to winter tire
-5 - Winter tire
next (6-1) elements are 1 3 0 0 -4
delete from array and check
2 -3 1 0
contains a negative number
so we can't use the winter tire all along
so ???change??? (but how do we decide here)
at 0 , Winter tire is needed for -4
so change
